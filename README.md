# AI Slugfest Conclusion (See: AI Slugfest.md prompt)

In conclusion, all the publicly facing (free) versions of AI have frontal lobe impairments to varying degrees based on how a human subject would be evaluated.  Given the nature of this test and how resolutely the AI's concluded they got the correct answer, if these were human subjects, we would conclude none were safe to navigate this world.  Most would be a danger to themselves and others!

# Addendum

After testing more recent developments (As of July 2025) that are not yet available to the public, the latest AI model(s) are able to solve unconventional or even contrived formulations of both existing and novel problems like this problem.  Well before the end of next year (2026) such models will become generally available.  It's unclear how this type of thinking problem was solved.  Hopefully, one of the Open Source variants will duplicate this capability.
